Steps:
1.) Download and set up all Python libraries you will use,
numpy,pandas for manipulating data frames and arraies, maplotlib for plotting
tkinter for user interface,openai to use Chat-GPT api for 
leveraging for some missing information, and statsmodels for Econometric-style OLS regression     [DONE]

2.) Set up working directory for project [DONE]

3.) Write down 20-30 interstate conflicts since 1950, identify all countries which you need data on
Identify years which you need data on [DONE]

4.) Write down all easily avaliable statistics for countries in economics,demogrphics and politics   [DONE]

Also, this division of variables can gives us additional opportunity to see which family of variables have strongest correlation with War out of 3.
NOTICE:this variable list is to signify what are commonly avaliable variables, and ones that will likely explain wars
it's not so much about what I will necessarily pick.
5.)Identify for which countries, which data you need (and is avaliable) and for which years.  [DONE]

6.)Search and download all needed data.     [DONE]

7.)Find way to filter data and create data frame (for each country) that contains all the necessary variables  [DONE]
How I will filter data:
I will write down all the variables I am looking for (from the what_data_to_look_for.txt)
Since how I write variable does not match row names in the data frame, I will write down keywords from my variable
       #and then use regex to find similar or matching variable names in data frame rows
I will use one of the data frames (for US) as study to find all the usefl variables this massive World bank data offers
After that I will filter through the varaiables that regex-keyword-matching produced, and pick ones I think matches 
       #the variables I wrote down in what_data_to_look_for.txt best
After I have set of usable variables, I will use my years_countries dictionary and usable variables set
       to create a function that will take data frames of country as arguement and
       from the data frame of country choose only rows that correspond to useful variables
       and columns that correspond to useful years, and return filtered data frame.
       I will store this new filtered data frame in the new folder, with the same names 
        (name corresponds to country name in combatant_countries set)
       

8.)Write function that utilizes regional data and world data, and ChatGpt api to deal with missing values.  [DONE]
fill rest of the remaining Na's with various methods (average, interpolate, 0). I will use interpolate technique since it is most efficient
However, since it is pretty hard to interpolate over rows for my kind of data frame I will first transpose dataframes and then interpolate.


9.)Use functions in 8 to fill missing values. Keep data frames transposed  [DONE]

10.)Find function that creates a custom data frame for each war based on year of war, beligerents of war,  [DONE]
and how many years before the war we track the war (the last variable will be custom based on data avaliability)
the data frame tracks all the economic,demographics, and political statsitics for both countries 5-10 years before the war
and has the varaible (which will be used as dependent variable later) Years_before_war. 

11.) Create war dataframe for all possible conflicts in the 3, and store it in separate folder  [DONE]

12.)Join all the data frames into one big data frame     [DONE]

13.)Run regressions in model based on data frame 12, and choose the best one. y=years before the war , x's are the economic,political and demographic variables.

14.) After regressions create a prediction model, that will use betas from prediction
to predict years before the war between two countries, based on inputed current statistics for said countries

15.)Make 2024 data frame for all statistics in 4, for all countries.

16.)Create a function that will utilize model in 14, and df in 15 to give predictions of years before the war
based on two countries chosen

17.) Use tkinter to create GUI for project. Part of GUI will be a page where person can choose from scroll-down search bar
two countries , and then press "see possible years before the war", and afterwards the result from functio 16 will be shown to the
user
